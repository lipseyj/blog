<h3>21.4: Explain why an object-oriented approach to software development may not be suitable for real-time systems.</h3>

<p>Object-oriented approach assumes that their are multiple instances of the same object, whereas real-time approach will be used in real time and needs to react to different input stimuli.</p>

<h3>22.6: Fixed-price contracts, where the contractor bids a fixed price to complete a system development, may be usd to move project risk from client to contractor. If anything else goes wrong, the contractor has to pay. Suggest how the use of such contracts may increase the likeliehood that product risks will arise.</h3>

<p>If you are constantly hiring contractors to do your coding, they may take different approaches or not understand the system. The company would be better off hiring a system developer that could take their time and that way the company wouldn't have to waste time with hiring contractors and then possibly making them pay for their mistakes. To try to fix a system in the same way that it was broken defies logic. As Einstein said: insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.</p>
