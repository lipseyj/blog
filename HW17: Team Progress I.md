<p>I think that currently my team, team 5, is at our best place yet. We're on the same page about what needs to get done and our communication is good. I'm glad that we changed our project, even though it took a little work to catch up, it didn't take long and we picked up the pace a little bit because of it. I think that we have all contributed to the project a fairly even amount and we're able to help each other out if one of us can't fully complete a task. Overall I'm much happier about where my team stands than a month ago with deliverable #2.</p>
