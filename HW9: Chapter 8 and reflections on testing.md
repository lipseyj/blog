<h3>8.7: Write a scenario that could be used to help design tests of the wilderness weather station system.</h3>

<p>Larry is a weatherman for the wilderness weather station. He wakes up one morning and notices it is raining. He makes a pot of coffee for the ride to the station. He restarts the system, since it has been on shutdown all night. Then Larry looks back at the weather station system and decides, since it is a Monday, that he will also reconfigure the system as one of their weekly duties. Then before he can report the weather he needs to check if the system is working correctly so the wrong weather isn't sent out, so he checks the status of the system. It comes up all clear so then he can report the weather. He leaves it on all day to collect the day's weather and at the end of the day, protocol states to put the system into power save so electricity isn't wasted, so Larry puts the system into power save and goes home.</p>

<h3>8.10: A common approach to system testing is to test the system until the testing budget is exhausted and then deliver the system to customers. Discuss the ethics of this approach for systems that are deliverd to external customers.</h3>

<p>This is not very ethical because they are giving them a system that they may use incorrectly due to nonspecific specifications of the system, or they may be getting a barely tested system depending on the budget given. Especially when giving a system to an external customer, you have to be careful that the bugs are minimal because your reputation is on the line so you don't want to give them something that won't work. Ethically, you will always be making a judgement call as far as when you give a system to an external customer because you can do as many tests as you can think of, but that doesn't mean that in practice a bug won't come up.</p>
