The main concern in No Silver Bullet was that there is no single fix that will make software cheaper or easier to create. Some of the other concerns that it states is within some of the properties of software including: capacity, conformity, changeability, and invisibility; in each one he has at least one concern. He even discusses how, within software engineering, there is no larger gap in any other type of engineering between the average software engineer and the experts. In Cherry Picking it is more about focusing on bad habits that programmers have and what they should be doing instead. It goes into more detail about how computer science is still a science and should be treated as such by analyzing it through the scientific method.The Google article stresses the importance of keeping old code, they keep all of their old code because they understand that it is extremely valuable. They go into great detail about how Google works and how its developers work together. It even explains why it works so well, since they use Piper, there is high redundancy and it optimizes latency for the developers. Using Citc also makes it much faster because nothing needs to be stored locally. It also discusses how trunk-based development combined with Piper creates and supports this monolithic source repository for Google. After explaining all of this is goes on to discuss the pros and cons of using each of their methods. One of the biggest take-aways that I found was that the software developers are constantly checking each other to make sure nobody messes up the system, and even if they do they have an immediate backup that will initiate itself if it doesn't work properly. In both Cherry Picking and No Silver Bullet, the authors discuss how updating code, both to new hardware and to the same program, can be perilous tasks especially if you do not constantly update. They both also discuss how being more experienced in coding reveals conceptual thinking that you wouldn't necessarily come to as a new programmer. Both No Silver Bullet and the Google articles both mention some of the properties of systems that make them hard to simplify. While the Google article is more specific to Google, No Silver Bullet also discusses some of the same issues involving complexity of algorithms, conformity within the system, how easy it is to make changes to the system, and trying to conceptualize these different data structures or systems created. In both the Google and Cherry Picking articles they discuss how checking for bugs in the system can be hard but also how it can be streamlined. They all mention certain habits for commenting and leaving notes that a programmer should be doing like keeping old code for simple fact that you don't try the same thing again or can learn from old mistakes you, or another programmer, have made. Each one discuss the common pitfalls and problems that software engineers have in building a system, either within a huge team like Google, or for an individual working either by themselves but more importantly, as a part of a team.
