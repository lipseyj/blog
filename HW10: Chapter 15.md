<h3>15.10: the reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intellectual property issues. If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the right to reuse the developed code? Does the software contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component? What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers of reusable components? Discuss these issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software.</h3>

<p>I think that the developer should have the copyright or intellectual property since they are the ones who wrote it, but it doesn't always end up that way. There are a lot of factors toward who would have property, how many developers were working on the project, did they write it from scratch or a previous build, etc. If it was a contractor like in this case, it is much harder because they are paying the contractor but he doesn't necessarily work for them. If it was an employee then the company would keep the property but since it is a contractor he should be able to keep it. I would say as a creative alternative to one of them keeping the property they could each keep it since the company won't reuse it for anything except what they already paid for.</p>
