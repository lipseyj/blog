<h3>17.10: Your company wishes to move from using desktop applications to accessing the same functionality remotely as services. Identify three risks that might arise and suggest how these risks may be reduced.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Security</li>
  <p>The security of the sytem would need to be increased or possibly modified to fit the new SaaS.</p>
  <li>Quality of Service</li>
  <p>The quality of service could be affected depending on the service(s) being provided. A solution would be to update the code so that the SaaS has the same quality of services as the desktop application.</p>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <p>Scalability is a common issue when changing from a desktop application to SaaS, one way to fix this is by adding more servers.</p>
</ul>
