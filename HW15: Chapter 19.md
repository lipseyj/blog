<h3>19.3: Why is it impossible to infer the emegent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?</h3>

<p>A complex system is exactly that, it is complex, so the system components, while giving insight into the system's properties, doesn't allow you to infer the emergent properties of the system as a whole. The emergent properties are properties of the system such as performance, reliability, usability, safety, and security. These properties are unable to be seen on a basic overview of the system from system components.</p>
