<h3>9.8: Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?</h3>

<p>The three types of software maintenance are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fault repairs to fix bugs and vulnerabilities: </li><br>
  <p>Repairing faults whether they are coding errors, which are fairly cheap to correct, or if they are design errors, which are more expensive since it may involve rewriting a few components of the system.</p><br>
  <li>Environmental adaption to adapt the software to new platforms and environments: </li><br>
  <p>This is required when some aspect of a system's environment is changed to adapt it to the new system.</p><br>
  <li>Functionality addition to add new features and to support new requirements: </li><br>
  <p>This is normally the easiest maintenance, with the least amount of changes, and is only necessary when the system requirements change responsively to organizational or business change.</p>
</ul>
<p>It is sometimes hard to distinguish between them because normally if there is some kind of Environmental adaption needed there also may be functionality addition as well to support the Environmental adaption, vice versa, or there could be faults that are caused by an Environmental adaption, etc.</p><br>

<h3>9.10: Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly request it?</h3>

<p>Software engineers do have a responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained because it is part of good coding practices. It is also almost a requirement if you are going to be working with anyone else because you should be working on the same code, and if one of your teamates cannot easily maintain the code then that is going to be a problem as the application or system is developed.</p>
